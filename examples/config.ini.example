# Example configuration for the Akita Meshtastic-Meshcore Bridge (AMMB)
# Copy this file to 'config.ini' in the project root and modify it.

[DEFAULT]
# --- Meshtastic Settings ---

# Serial port for the Meshtastic device.
# Find the correct port for your system (e.g., check Device Manager on Windows,
# or run 'meshtastic --port list' or check /dev/tty* on Linux).
# Example Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0
# Example Windows: COM3
MESHTASTIC_SERIAL_PORT = /dev/ttyUSB0


# --- Meshcore Settings ---

# Serial port for the Meshcore device.
# Find the correct port for your system.
# Example Linux: /dev/ttyS0
# Example Windows: COM4
MESHCORE_SERIAL_PORT = /dev/ttyS0

# Baud rate for the Meshcore serial connection.
# This MUST match the setting configured on your Meshcore device.
# Common values include 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.
MESHCORE_BAUD_RATE = 9600

# Protocol handler for Meshcore serial communication.
# Determines how messages are encoded/decoded when sent/received over serial.
# Built-in options:
#   json_newline: Expects/sends newline-terminated UTF-8 encoded JSON strings.
#                 See docs/architecture.md for the expected JSON structure.
# You can add custom protocols in ammb/protocol.py if needed.
MESHCORE_PROTOCOL = json_newline

# Conceptual Network ID for Meshcore (optional).
# Currently used mainly for logging/informational purposes.
# Might be used in future translation logic.
MESHCORE_NETWORK_ID = ammb_default_net


# --- Bridge Settings ---

# Identifier for the bridge node itself on the Meshtastic network.
# This helps prevent the bridge from processing messages it sent itself.
# It's recommended to use the Meshtastic node ID format (hex string starting with '!').
# You can find your Meshtastic node's ID using 'meshtastic --info'.
# If left blank, the bridge will try to use the connected node's actual ID,
# but setting it explicitly can be more reliable.
BRIDGE_NODE_ID = !ammb_bridge

# Maximum size for the internal message queues (to_meshtastic, to_meshcore).
# If a queue becomes full, new messages for that destination will be dropped.
MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE = 100


# --- Logging Settings ---

# Logging level for console output. Controls the verbosity of logs.
# Options (from least to most verbose):
#   CRITICAL
#   ERROR
#   WARNING
#   INFO (default)
#   DEBUG
LOG_LEVEL = INFO


# --- Future / Unimplemented Settings ---
# These are placeholders and not currently used by the code.
# RETRY_COUNT = 3
# RETRY_DELAY = 1
